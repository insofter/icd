  Tabele: events, flow
    id         // event id
    itd_id     // input transition detector (e.g photocell) id
    dtm        // date and time of the event
    state      // 1 (0->1) or 0 (1->0)
    flags      // NOT SENT (1), SENT (0) (= aggregated into a flow period)

  Flow table:
    id         // period id
    itd_id     // input transition detector (e.g photocell) id
    dtm        // date and time of the beginning of the period
    cnt        // number of events = number of transitions 0->1
    dark_time  // time the photocell was blocked within this period
    work_time  // time the photocell was working within this period
    test       // photocell test result; the test performed at some time within this period
    flags      // one of: OPEN (2), NOT SENT (1), SENT (0) (we need to distiguish between OPEN periods
               // (ones that are still being modified) and NOT SENT (finished but not yet sent)
               // as we want to send all periods, but also want to resend the OPEN one in the future
               // once it is finished. Also, we don't want to judge if a row is OPEN or not
               // by the current time as all sort of dealys are expected in the system.

Moduły:

icd-itd-kmod              # input transition detector kernel module

icd-itd-daemon            # input transition detector daemon

icd-init-net              # reads config db and configures the network
                          # also saves the current settings into the db
icd-init-livedb           # creates empty database and populates it with
                          # the data from archive db
icd-aggregate-data        # creates and updates flow entries based on events table
icd-archive-data          # copies relevant data from temp db into data db
                          # also removes outdated entries
icd-transfer-data         # transfers data from live db to external server
                          # with custom data exchange protocol based on HTTP POST
icd-test-detector         # Runs a test common for all detectors; the result
                          # of the tests is presented on the program standard output
                          # but is also registered in live db (this can be controlled
                          # by a command line parameter)

icd-init:
  - runs icd-init-livedb
  - runs insmod icd-transition-detector-kmod
  - starts icd-transition-detector-daemon
  - runs icd-init-net
